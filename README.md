## Getting Started

### How to install

The preferred way to install the Cobalt SDK for Node.js is to use the npm package manager. Simply type the following into a terminal window:

~~~
 npm i @cobaltio/cobalt
~~~

### Usage

The Cobalt SDK for JavaScript bundles TypeScript definition files for use in TypeScript projects. We aim to keep these TypeScript definition files updated with each release for any public api.

#### **Pre-requisites for Typescript**

* Use TypeScript v2.x
* If you are targeting at es5 or older ECMA standards, your tsconfig.json has to include 'es5' and 'es2015.promise' under compilerOptions.lib. See tsconfig.json for an example.
* Includes the TypeScript definitions for node. You can use npm to install this by typing the following into a terminal window:

    ~~~
    npm install --save-dev @types/node
    ~~~

To use the TypeScript definition files within a Node.js project, simply import Cobalt-sdk as you normally would.

**In a TypeScript file:**

```TypeScript
import Cobalt from '@cobaltio/cobalt';
```

>NOTE: You might need to add "esModuleInterop": true to compilerOptions of your tsconfig.json.


**In a JavaScript file:**
```JavaScript
const Cobalt = require('@cobaltio/cobalt');
```

### Initializing Cobalt Client
To use the Cobalt SDK you first need to Sign Up with getCobalt & get the API key from Dashboard.

_Visit **[gocobalt.io](https://www.gocobalt.io/ "Cobalt Home")** to get the API key now!_

Once you have you api key, you can initialize the Cobalt Client by:


TypeScript :
```TypeScript
import Cobalt from '@cobaltio/cobalt';

const Client:Cobalt = new Cobalt({
    apiKey:"<Your Api Key>"
});
```

JavaScript :
```JavaScript
const Cobalt = require('@cobaltio/cobalt');

const Client = new Cobalt({
    apiKey:"<Your Api Key>"
});
```

## Using Cobalt APIs

Once the Client has been initialized you can make use of Cobalt APIs for getting things done and running for your platform. Please find the detailed list and documentations of the Cobalt APIs at : **[https://gocobalt.io/developers](https://www.gocobalt.io/developers "Cobalt API Documentation")**

>NOTE: Cobalt APIs require API Key to be accessed. _Visit **[gocobalt.io](https://www.gocobalt.io "Cobalt Home")** to get the API key now!_


**Examples:**

* **Create Linked Account** - createLinkedAccount
This is probably the first api that you'd be using. This Api creates a Linked Account for the user for whos behalf you'd be calling the Cobalt APIs. The api expects ```account_id``` & ```embed_id```. You can call the API like: 

```JavaScript
Client.createLinkedAccount({
    account_id:"<Account Id of the user eg: example@someemail.com>",
    embed_id:"<Embed ID assigned to the user>"
}).then(data=>{
    console.log("data", data)
}).catch(e=>{
    console.log("error", e.message)
})
```

* **Get Token For A Linked Account** - getTokenForLinkedAccount
This is probably the first api that you'd be using. This Api creates a Linked Account for the user for whos behalf you'd be calling the Cobalt APIs. The api expects ```linked_account_id```. You can call the API like: 

```JavaScript
Client.getTokenForLinkedAccount({
    linked_account_id:"<Account Id of the user eg: example@someemail.com>"
}).then(data=>{
    console.log("data", data)
}).catch(e=>{
    console.log("error", e.message)
})
```

* **Get All Published Templates** - getAllTemplates
This API returns all published Cobalt Templates. The method expects a ```linked_account_id``` as the mandatory first argument. You can call the API like: 
```JavaScript
Client.getAllTemplates("<linked_account_id>").then(data=>{
    console.log("data", data)
}).catch(e=>{
    console.log("error", e.message)
})
```
Use pagination by passing ```page``` and ```limit``` as parameters;
```JavaScript
Client.getAllTemplates("<linked_account_id>", {
    page:5,
    limit:10
})
```


* **Get All Workflows** - getAllWorkflows
This API returns all available Cobalt Workflows. The method expects a ```linked_account_id``` as the mandatory first argument. You can call the API like: 
```JavaScript
Client.getWorkflows("<linked_account_id>").then(data=>{
    console.log("data", data)
}).catch(e=>{
    console.log("error", e.message)
})
```
Use pagination by passing ```page``` and ```limit``` as parameters;
```JavaScript
Client.getWorkflows("<linked_account_id>", {
    page:5,
    limit:10
})
```

* **Delete a Workflow** - getAllWorkflows
This API Deletes a Cobalt Workflow. The method expects a ```workflow_id``` as the mandatory first argument. You can call the API like: 
```JavaScript
Client.deleteWorkflow("<workflow_id>").then(data=>{
    console.log("data", data)
}).catch(e=>{
    console.log("error", e.message)
})
```


## Using Async Await 

Cobalt APis can be called using popular Async Await method too:

```JavaScript
await Client.createLinkedAccount({
    account_id:"<Account Id of the user eg: example@someemail.com>",
    embed_id:"<Embed Id assigned to the user>"
})
```

Using Try Catch Block: 

```JavaScript
try{
    const data = await Client.createLinkedAccount({
                    account_id:"<Account Id of the user eg: example@someemail.com>",
                    embed_id:"<Embed ID assigned to the user>"
                })
    console.log(data) // {...data in json format}
}catch(error){
    console.log(error.message)
}
```
